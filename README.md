# notify

#### Dependencies: None whatsoever (<--- that's not a mod :P)

notify is a very simple mod that comprises of just one command `/notify`, which is _very_ similar to the builtin `/msg` command, except for the fact that /notify displays a message by means of a formspec, instead of displaying the message via chat. Due to the higher potential for abuse, the use of this command is restricted to moderators and above.

## Usage
- `/notify <player_name> <msg>`
