# notify

### Dependencies: None

notify is a very simple mod that comprises of just one command `/notify`, which is _very_ similar to the builtin `/msg` command, except for the fact that /notify displays a message using HUD elements (instead of displaying via chat) for better noticeability. Due to the higher potential for abuse, the use of this command is restricted to moderators and above.

### Usage
`/notify <player_name> <msg>`

### Example
`/notify LegendaryGriefer Stop griefing or face a ban!`
